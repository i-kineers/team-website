<h2>Meet the Team</h2>
    
    <p>
        We are a <strong>community-based</strong> robotics team dedicated to the <strong>FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)</strong> competition. Based in <strong>Orange County, California</strong>, we are a group of passionate students united by a drive to learn, build, and compete.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Our mission goes beyond building robots; we focus on developing crucial <strong>STEM skills</strong>—from mechanical design and coding to strategic thinking and problem-solving. We live the core <strong>FTC principles and values</strong> by practicing <strong>Gracious Professionalism</strong> (competing fiercely while treating everyone with respect) and <strong>Coopertition</strong> (working together even with rival teams).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Through the FTC season, our members discover how to <strong>collaborate effectively</strong> in a team environment, preparing them to tackle real-world challenges with creativity and skill.
    </p>
